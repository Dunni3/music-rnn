it looks like the previous baseline might be overfitting at the beginning, since i have it doing 650 batches per file,
training loss goes to 0 immediately and test loss increases rapidly.

i'm going to try setting shuffle=true for the training dataloader for this iteration

found bug: returning entire file for each slice..
